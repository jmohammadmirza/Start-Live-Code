		<h2>What is Start Tank?</h2>

		<p>Start Tank is a PayPal initiative that provides shared innovation space for the next generation of startups. Our hope is that it accelerates the growth of the Boston startup ecosystem by enabling entrepreneurs to collaborate with each other, work alongside the PayPal team, tap into a vast network of contacts and leverage seasoned entrepreneurs' expertise.</p>

		<h2>Why is PayPal doing this?</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>We want to support innovation at its source. By helping startups with their immediate and strategic needs, we can positively influence and grow the local ecosystem. </li>
		<li>Many of our employees are entrepreneurs themselves. Allowing them to be an active part of local innovation allows them to grow as mentors and subject matter experts.</li>
		<li>PayPal is a leader in the payments industry and synergies exist with startups that share our vision of connected commerce. </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>What are the terms?</h2>

		<li>The program duration is a six-month cycle with the option to re-apply for up to one year total time. Either party (PayPal or participant) can terminate with 30-day notice.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>What is the timeline of the cycles?</h2>

		<p>There are two six-month cycles per year, one starting in September and one in March. Applications open roughly three-months prior to the beginning of the cycle.</p>

		</ul>
		
		<h2>How we can help accelerate your startup?</h2>

		<p>In addition to free co-working space, we can help in three key ways:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Advice / expertise - access to PayPal mentors from all different functional areas</li>
		<li>Fundraising - we'll help you refine your pitch and get access to angels and VCs</li>
		<li>Recruiting and connections - tap into our network to recruit for talent or make business connections/partnerships</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h2>What are the etiquette / ground rules with respect to the space?</h2>

		<p>We expect all members of the community to be respectful to each other and when using the common facilities.
